1. **Documentation**: Consider adding more documentation and inline code comments for clarity throughout the codebase. This will help new contributors and users understand the logic better.

2. **Unit Tests**: It would be beneficial to write unit tests for the new modules (APIGet, chatfunc, payfunc, MedicineSearch) to ensure they function as intended and to catch any potential issues early.

3. **Code Consistency**: Please ensure that the naming conventions and code style are consistent throughout the project. This improves readability and maintainability.

4. **Usage Examples**: Providing usage examples in the README can greatly help users understand how to effectively use the new features and modules.

5. **Error Handling**: Make sure to verify error handling and edge cases in the new features to ensure robustness and prevent unexpected behavior.
